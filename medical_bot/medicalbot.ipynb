It's crucial to ensure proper form and technique during squats to avoid putting unnecessary strain on the knees. Gradually increasing the intensity and weight used in workouts can also help prevent overuse injuries. For immediate relief, applying ice, resting, and considering over-the-counter pain relievers may help. Consulting with a healthcare professional or a fitness expert to assess and adjust squat form, as well as to discuss any persistent pain or concerns, is highly recommended. Additionally, incorporating exercises that strengthen the muscles around the knee can provide support and help prevent future injuries.\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n\nMediGenie Response: Knee pain after starting barbell squats could be due to several conditions including patellofemoral pain syndrome, ligament sprains, meniscal tears, or tendonitis.
